# siege-warfare
A 3D (Three.js + Physi.js) turn-based game with cannon fire and obstacle destruction.</br></br>
This game demonstrates use of not just a graphics engine such as Three.js, but that of a physics engine (Physi.js).</br></br>
There are a number of camera views; number keys can toggle between them.</br></br>
Three types of ammunition (c-key, v-key, b-key) demonstrate a wider control over the physics engine.</br></br>
Event listeners were used to determine relevant collisions and manage their respective responses.</br></br>
Three separate level themes are present, randomly selected whenever page loads. Page refresh can access these. Later, a toggle will be added to offer manual switching of level themes.</br></br>
Fortresses and targets were randomly generated under a rudimentary method with greater emphasis placed on not overlapping rather than a true random appearance.</br></br>
